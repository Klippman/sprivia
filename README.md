Sprivia is a sports trivia application delivered by Ruby on Rails. The users can track their own results by referring to their interactive chart, or by simply checking the leaderboard to gauge rank within the user community. Furthermore, I implemented CRUD functionality allowing the registered users to post playful banter, presenting the opportunity for fellow members to comment and engage in conversation. AJAX assists with making the API call to open trivia databaseâ€™s generated URL retrieving the content. JavaScript and jQuery, through the use of built-in functions and methods, enables the app to dynamically render the trivia questions and answers to the page in a continuous, random fashion. Randomizing the questions and answers provides a fresh approach during each new trivia session.
